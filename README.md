### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Yan, I'm a senior undergraduate math student at the University of British Columbia.

I'm currently working as software engineering intern at Coursera on the data team. Previously I was a machine learning intern at Vector Institute, a Canadian research lab under the University of Toronto.

I'm broadly interested in solving hard technical problems and have experience in a variety of areas, including data/machine learning, low-level programming in C/C++, mobile development, and general software engineering.

Please feel free to reach out to chat about anything!
